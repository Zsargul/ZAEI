**<h2 align="center">Zsargul's Artix Environment Initializer</h2>**

ZAEI (pronounced "zey"), is a tool inspired by [Luke Smith's LARBS](https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/LARBS), for automatically downloading and/or configuring my packages, graphical display, and other configurations that I use on my Artix install. While inspired by Luke Smith's script, I felt like writing my own utility and fine-tuning it to my own needs and specific setup. I did however choose to write this one in C instead of bash. While bash would likely be more efficient and more lightweight, I like C and didn't want to just copy Luke Smith's scripts. This probably doesn't matter as I'll likely be the only one using this. If you're looking for something to use yourself, I recommend using Luke Smith's script cause they're probably better and more easily customisable for general use cases.
