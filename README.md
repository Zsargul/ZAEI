**<h1 align="center">Zsargul's Artix Rice Deployment Script</h1>**

The following is a bash script, inspired by [Luke Smith's LARBS](https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/LARBS), for automatically downloading config files & packages for my Artix rice. While inspired by Luke Smith's script, I felt like writing my own utility and fine-tuning it to my own needs and specific setup. If you're looking for something to use yourself, I recommend using Luke Smith's cause it's most likely better and more elegant.
